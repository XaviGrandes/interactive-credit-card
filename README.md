## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
 I'm Xavi Grandes and I coded this challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge
I build an interactive card component where the user can create his/her card.

Users are able to:

- input carholder name
- input card number (max 16 digit)
- input month, year and cvc

Any input can be blank, in that case I show an alert.
in case the client write with a wrong format some input box, there is an alert.

if all the input are correct, then disapear the form and show a thank you component.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS (BEM methodology and Saas)
